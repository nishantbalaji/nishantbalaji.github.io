# Hey there! 👋

Welcome to the source code for my website! I've currently built this in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) as a way to learn these frameworks. The old site that was built in pure HTML and CSS will soon be deprecated as well. You can see the new site at [nishantbalaji.com](https://nishantbalaji.com) and the old one at [nishantbalaji.github.io](https://nishantbalaji.github.io).
